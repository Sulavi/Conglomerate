	<h1>The Sky Below</h1>
	
	<p>Theodore listened to the wind whispering in his ears, telling him of all the mysteries out there, left to be discovered. He knew there was something out there; there had to be. The sky was full of possibilities just waiting to be discovered. The land was just so small. The endless farming and political skirmishes in the land were dwarfed by the vast sky and it’s potential. Unfortunately, no one else shared his vision. They were all content to live their tedious little lives, denying the truth that lay just out of reach. He would show them. His spire had failed to produce any real results, but it was just a matter of time before one of his other ideas bore fruit. He was almost ready to put his next plan into action. Using a farmer’s harness and a lot of rope, he could dangle himself from his spire and get even more distance. He just needed someone to help him get back up. He had tried this approach before he had built the spire to little effect, but hopefully it would be different this time. If he was honest with himself, he didn’t really expect to discover anything new this way; it simply didn’t give him enough range. However, it was still worth a shot. He would have to make do until some of his more extreme ideas could be implemented.

	The patter of approaching footsteps jarred Theodore out of his musings. That would be his sister Geneva coming to get him for dinner. He started back up the spire before she could scream down at him. If he was late his mother would tan his hide. Of course, his hurry to get back didn’t stop Geneva at all. He knew she could hear him climbing, but she screamed at him to come anyway and immediately turned to go back home. She was such an annoying little brat. She had an obnoxiously loud voice and was always chattering on about some benign drama with or about her friends. It was always easy to tell where she was. Theodore reached the top of the spire and hurried after her.
